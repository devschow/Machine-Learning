# Predictive Analytics in Real Estate

## Introduction üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Real estate is a dynamic market with fluctuating property values, making it essential for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. The Predictive Analytics in Real Estate project leverages machine learning techniques to predict housing prices, offering valuable insights that empower stakeholders in the real estate market.

## Project Overview

Our project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques, providing valuable insights for both buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

## Code and Resources Used
language: Python 
Development Environment: Google Colab 
Libraries and Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Workflow üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öí 

1. Data Collection and Exploration:

- Collected a dataset containing information on housing prices, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and various other features.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data, identify patterns, and uncover key insights.

2. Descriptive Statistics 

- Utilized descriptive statistics to summarize key characteristics of the dataset, including mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.
- Analyzed summary statistics to gain an initial understanding of the central tendencies and variabilities in housing prices, area, bedrooms, and other features.

3. Correlation Analysis:

- Investigated the relationships between different variables using correlation analysis.

- Identified significant correlations, such as the positive correlation between house price and area, as well as the moderate correlation between bathrooms and price.

3. Data Preprocessing:

- Processed categorical variables through encoding techniques for efficient model training.
- Applied feature scaling to normalize numerical variables, ensuring a balanced influence on the model.

4. Modeling and Evaluation:

- Selected linear regression as the modeling approach for predicting housing prices.
- Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, providing a comprehensive understanding of predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion
The project is dedicated to predicting housing prices in the real estate market using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset enriched with diverse features, the insights gained through data analysis and modeling provide a valuable resource for stakeholders in the real estate market, empowering them to make informed decisions.
